bugfixes:
  - display now does a better job of mapping warnings/errors to the proper log severity when using ansible.log. We still use color as a fallback mapping (now prioritiezed by severity) but mostly rely on it beind directly set by warnning/errors calls.
minor_changes:
  - ansible.log now also shows log severity field
