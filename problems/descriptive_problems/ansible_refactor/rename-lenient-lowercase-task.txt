Please rename the function `lenient_lowercase` to `lowercase_of_list` in the file named `formatters.py` located in `lib/ansible/module_utils/common/text`. Additionally, update all references to `lenient_lowercase` across the repository, including in the file named `basic.py` located in `lib/ansible/module_utils`, and ensure the test file previously named `test_lenient_lowercase.py` in `test/units/module_utils/common/text/formatters` is renamed to `test_lowercase_of_list.py`. Also, update the content of this test file to reflect the new function name and ensure no traces of the old function name remain in the comments or the code.
