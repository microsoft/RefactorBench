Create a new file named utils.py in the module_utils directory and transfer the functions heuristic_log_sanitize and missing_required_lib into this new file from their original locations. Remove these functions from their original locations after transferring. Subsequently, update all the references to these functions in the repository, ensuring files such as basic.py, packages.py, urls.py, deb822_repository.py, expect.py, pip.py, wait_for.py, netconf __init__.py, missing_required_lib.py, test_heuristic_log_sanitize.py in the module_utils library, and network_cli.py in ansible_collections/ansible/netcommon plugins connection directory are pointing to ansible.module_utils.utils. This ensures a cohesive usage across the differing file dependencies that previously utilized these functions.
