Transfer all classes and related information from the file namespace.py located in the folder module_utils/facts to the file compat.py within the same folder. After completing the transfer, update the references to these classes in relevant files throughout the repository, including ansible_collector.py, facter.py, ohai.py, setup.py, and test_ansible_collector.py, to ensure that they now correctly point to compat.py. Make sure that the classes are not referenced from namespace.py in these files after the transfer.
