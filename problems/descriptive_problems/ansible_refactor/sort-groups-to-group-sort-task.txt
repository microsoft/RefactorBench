Please rename the function 'sort_groups' to 'group_sort' in the file 'helpers.py' within the 'ansible/inventory' directory, and ensure that this renamed function is appropriately referenced as 'group_sort' in the files 'manager.py' in the 'ansible/vars' directory and elsewhere throughout the repository. Additionally, verify that the 'group_sort' function in 'helpers.py' includes a particular lambda expression for sorting and ensure that it is being correctly called in the methods 'get_group_vars' in the same 'helpers.py' file and 'get_vars' of the 'VariableManager' class within 'manager.py'.
