Transfer all functionalities and associated content from the quoting.py file to the splitter.py file within the lib/ansible/parsing directory of the Ansible codebase. After moving the content, ensure that references in important files such as config.py, dataloader.py, schema.py, and test_unquote.py are updated to reflect the use of splitter.py instead of quoting.py. Additionally, ensure that the quoting.py file is removed from the repository after successfully migrating its contents and updating all necessary references.
