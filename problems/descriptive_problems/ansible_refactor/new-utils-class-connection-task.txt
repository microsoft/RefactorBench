Refactor the 'connection.py' file in the Ansible library by creating a new class called ConnectionUtils that combines the standalone functions write_to_stream, send_data, recv_data, exec_command, and request_builder. After creating this class, update all references to these functions in the files 'task_executor.py', 'ansible_connection_cli_stub.py', and within 'connection.py' itself to use the new ConnectionUtils class. Ensure any relevant imports or function usages are adjusted accordingly in these files.
