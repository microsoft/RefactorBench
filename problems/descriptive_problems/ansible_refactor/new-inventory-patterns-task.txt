Relocate the functions `order_patterns` and `split_host_pattern` from the file `manager.py` within the `inventory` directory to a newly created file named `patterns.py` in the same `inventory` directory. Subsequent to this change, ensure to update all references to these functions throughout the entire repository to reflect their new location in `patterns.py`. However, do not create a new test file specifically for `patterns.py`.
