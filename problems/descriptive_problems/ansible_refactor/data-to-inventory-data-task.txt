Rename the file named data.py located in the ansible/inventory directory to inventory_data.py. After renaming, identify and update all references and imports of this file across the entire repository. Specifically, files like manager.py and test_constructed.py will require updates to their import statements to reflect the new filename. Ensure that after renaming, no file in the repository is attempting to import from the old data.py file name.
