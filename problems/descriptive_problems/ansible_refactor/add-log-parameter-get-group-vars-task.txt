Modify the function `get_group_vars` in the file `helpers.py` located within the `ansible/inventory` directory to include a new parameter named `log` with a default value of `true`. Also, update calls to this function throughout the repository to explicitly pass `log=False` where appropriate. This specifically includes modifying the `get_vars` method within the `VariableManager` class in `manager.py` under the `ansible/vars` directory, ensuring `log=False` is used when calling `get_group_vars`. Other instances in the repository where `get_group_vars` is called should not pass the `log` parameter unless explicitly stated.
