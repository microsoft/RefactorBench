Create a new class named GunzipParams in the file 'gz.py' located within the 'utils' directory of the 'scrapy' repository. This class should include the attributes 'data' and 'max_size'. Update the signature of the 'gunzip' function in the same 'gz.py' file so that it accepts a GunzipParams object as its only parameter and adjusts its usage across the repository. Make sure all references and imports related to gunzip actions in files like 'sitemap.py' and 'httpcompression.py' within the 'spiders' and 'downloadermiddlewares' directories respectively, are updated to utilize this new GunzipParams object.
