Please relocate the functions verify_url_scheme, sanitize_module_name, and extract_domain from the file genspider.py located in the scrapy/commands directory to the utils url file named url.py in the scrapy/utils directory. After moving these functions, ensure that you update the import statements in genspider.py to properly import these functions from their new location in url.py. Modify any necessary import statements in url.py to maintain functionality after the functions are relocated.
