Modify the 'disconnect_all' function in the file signal.py located in the utils directory to include an additional boolean parameter named 'log' with a default value of True. Additionally, update any existing function calls to 'disconnect_all' in the files test_engine.py and test_pipeline_media.py within the tests directory to explicitly include the parameter 'log' with a value of False. Ensure that signalmanager.py remains unchanged.
