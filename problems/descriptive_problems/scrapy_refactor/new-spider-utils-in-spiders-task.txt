Create a new Python file named `spider_utils.py` within the `scrapy/spiders` directory. Transfer all global-level functions (functions not contained within any class) from files such as `sitemap.py` and `crawl.py` located in the same directory into `spider_utils.py`. Subsequently, adjust the import statements in these source files to use the functions from `spider_utils.py`, ensuring you maintain the same variable and function naming conventions as previously established.
