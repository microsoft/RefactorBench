Create a new file named downloadermiddlewares.py within the utils directory of the Scrapy project and relocate the standalone functions get_status_size and get_header_size from the downloadermiddlewares class in the stats.py file to this new file. Ensure that these functions are correctly imported back into the stats.py file where they are utilized. Follow the necessary conventions for managing imports, such as typing and Scrapy-specific utilities, to maintain functionality.
