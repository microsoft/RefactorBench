Replace all references and uses of the 'NotSupported' exception with the 'Unsupported' exception in the Scrapy project repository. Specifically, update imports, class definitions, and exception raising or handling in the files located in the 'scrapy/core/downloader/handlers/', 'scrapy/http/response/', 'scrapy/spiders/', 'tests/', 'scrapy/exceptions.py', and the documentation file 'docs/topics/exceptions.rst'. Ensure that 'Unsupported' inherits from Exception where it is newly defined and is properly employed in place of 'NotSupported' across the indicated modules and documentation.
