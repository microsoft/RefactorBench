Modify the function definition of `job_dir` in the file `job.py` to include an additional boolean parameter named `log` with a default value of `True`. Ensure to update all instances where the `job_dir` function is called in the files `dupefilters.py`, `spiderstate.py`, and `scheduler.py` to explicitly set this new parameter to `False`. Additionally, ensure that the module `logging` is imported in the `job.py` file where `job_dir` is defined.
