In the scrapy/utils/engine.py file, prepend an underscore to the names of functions related to engine status, such as renaming 'get_engine_status' to '_get_engine_status'. After modifying these function names, ensure that you update all occurrences and references of these names across the entire repository where they are used or imported—including, but not limited to, debug.py, telnet.py, memusage.py, extensions.rst in the docs, and test_crawl.py—to reflect the new names with prefixed underscores. Ensure that these functions are only used internally within the Scrapy project, as indicated by the new function naming convention.
