In the file named testproc.py located in the scrapy/utils directory, rename the class ProcessTest to TestProc to match the filename. Additionally, update all occurrences where this class is referenced throughout the repository to reflect this change, including in files such as test_command_fetch.py, test_command_parse.py, test_command_shell.py, and test_command_version.py, ensuring the class and its methods like execute and _process_finished are properly accessed under the new name.
