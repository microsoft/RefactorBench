Create a new class called VerifyReactor within the file reactor.py located in the scrapy/utils directory. This class should encapsulate the two functions: verify_installed and is_asyncio_reactor_installed. Once created, update all existing references across the repository to these functions so that they are accessed via the new VerifyReactor class. This includes modifying any relevant import statements in files like defer.py, crawler.py, and various documentation and test files (e.g., asyncio.rst, test_utils_asyncio.py) to ensure the VerifyReactor class is correctly utilized. Be sure to revise the documentation wherever these methods are mentioned to refer to their new location within the VerifyReactor class.
