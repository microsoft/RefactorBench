Transfer all independent functions from the file `options.py` in the `tornado` directory to a new file named `global_options.py` in the same directory. Additionally, update all relevant import statements across various files in the repository, ensuring that places such as `blog.py`, `facebook.py`, `file_uploader.py`, and others correctly reference `global_options.py` instead. This update should address all occurrences of these functions, including in any demo or test files.
