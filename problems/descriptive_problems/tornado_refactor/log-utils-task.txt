Move the functions `enable_pretty_logging()` and `define_logging_options()` from the file `log.py` in the Tornado framework to a new file named `global_log_options.py`. Ensure after moving that `enable_pretty_logging()` and `define_logging_options()` no longer exist in `log.py`, and update any necessary imports in files such as `options.py` and `log_test.py` to reflect this change.
