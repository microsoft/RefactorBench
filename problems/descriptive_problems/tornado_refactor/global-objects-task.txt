Rework the handling of 'dummy_executor' in the Tornado framework to centralize its definition. Move the definition of 'dummy_executor' to a new file named `_globals.py`. Ensure that `wsgi.py` and `netutil.py` within the Tornado directory import `dummy_executor` specifically from `tornado._globals`. Also, remove or refactor any existing references or definitions of `dummy_executor` in `concurrent.py` to ensure it is no longer defined or directly referenced there.
