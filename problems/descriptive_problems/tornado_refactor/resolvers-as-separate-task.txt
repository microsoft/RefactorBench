Please transfer the Resolver class along with all its subclass dependencies from the netutils module to a newly created file named resolver.py within the tornado directory. After relocating these classes, ensure to adjust all import statements across the repository that reference the Resolver or any of its subclasses accordingly. This includes updating files like websocket.py, tcpclient.py, and various test files like websocket_test.py and simple_httpclient_test.py, ensuring they accurately reference the new location of these classes.
