Refactor the code in the 'tornado' module by integrating the 'LOCALE_NAMES' constant directly into the 'locale.py' file from '_locale_data.py', and subsequently eliminate the '_locale_data.py' file. Ensure that after moving 'LOCALE_NAMES', no import statements in 'locale.py' are trying to import it from '_locale_data.py', preserving the functionality but consolidating related data and simplifying the module structure.
