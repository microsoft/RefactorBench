Refactor the `enable_pretty_logging()` function by moving it from the `log.py` file in the Tornado framework to the `OptionParser` class located in the `options.py` file. Ensure that this transition involves proper handling and integration of logging functionalities needed by `OptionParser`, such as importing necessary logging and logging handlers in the `options.py` file. Follow up by removing the `enable_pretty_logging()` function definition from `log.py` to ensure that it does not exist there anymore.
