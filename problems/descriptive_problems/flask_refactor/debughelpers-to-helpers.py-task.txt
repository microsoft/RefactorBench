Identify and move all standalone functions (those not contained within any class) from the file debughelpers.py to helpers.py within the Flask project's 'src/flask' directory. Ensure that after transferring these functions, you adjust import statements in the repository that might be affected by this move. This task specifically includes transferring functions such as 'attach_enctype_error_multidict', '_dump_loader_info', and 'explain_template_loading_attempts'. Make sure these functions are removed from debughelpers.py and correctly added and refactored in helpers.py to maintain functionality.
