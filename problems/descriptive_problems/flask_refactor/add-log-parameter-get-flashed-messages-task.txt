Please update the file named 'helpers.py' in the Flask framework to include an additional boolean parameter 'log' to the function 'get_flashed_messages', setting its default value to False. Additionally, modify the relevant test cases in the file 'test_basic.py' to ensure that all calls to 'get_flashed_messages' explicitly pass the argument 'log=True'. This change intends to enhance debugging capabilities by allowing the logging of messages when necessary.
