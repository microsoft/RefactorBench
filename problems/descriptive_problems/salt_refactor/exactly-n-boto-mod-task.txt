Modify the boto3mod.py file by removing any existing definitions for exactly_n and exactly_1 functions, and instead, directly import these functions from botomod.py. Specifically, import exactly_n and exactly_1, and make sure they use the imported functions imported_exactly_n and imported_exactly_1 respectively from the botomod.py file. This adjustment avoids repetitive code definitions in boto3mod.py and keeps the code cleaner.
