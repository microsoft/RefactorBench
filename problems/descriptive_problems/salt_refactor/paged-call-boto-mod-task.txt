In the 'boto3mod.py' file located within the 'salt/utils' directory, update the definition of the 'paged_call' function so that it no longer contains its independent implementation. Instead, it should directly use 'paged_call' imported from 'botomod.py' by renaming it to 'imported_paged_call' within 'boto3mod.py'. Ensure that 'botomod.py' retains its complete version of the 'paged_call' function with all its key elements such as docstrings, the 'pop' operation for 'marker_flag', and the while loop handling.
