Modify the function 'get_capability_definitions' in the file 'pbm.py' within the 'salt/utils/' directory to include an additional boolean parameter named 'log' which defaults to False. Then, in the file 'vsphere.py' within the 'salt/modules/' directory, ensure that all existing calls to 'get_capability_definitions' explicitly set this 'log' parameter to True. However, in the file 'test_pbm.py' within the 'tests/unit/utils/' directory, where this function is used in tests, the 'log' parameter should either be explicitly set to False or not included in the function calls.
