Transfer all contents from the 'iam.py' file in the utils directory into the 'aws.py' file located in the salt/utils directory. This consolidation should include any functions, imports, and any other relevant code components from 'iam.py'. Ensure you update the 'aws.py' to retain functionality and cleanly integrate the incoming code. After transferring, make sure to remove the 'iam.py' file permanently from the utils directory.
