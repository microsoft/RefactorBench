Please update the constant EX_PILLAR_FAILURE to EX_PILLAR_FAIL in the `exitcodes.py` file within the Salt repository. Make sure to revise all references to this constant in both the `state.py` file located in the `salt/client/ssh/wrapper/` directory and the `state.py` file located in the `salt/modules/` directory so that they reference the updated constant name EX_PILLAR_FAIL instead of the old name EX_PILLAR_FAILURE.
