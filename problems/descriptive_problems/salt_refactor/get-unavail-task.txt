Change the exit code name from EX_UNAVAILABLE to EX_UNAVAIL in the `exitcodes.py` file located in the `salt/defaults/` directory for clarity and ease of use. Make sure to also update all references to this exit code in the `scripts.py` and `parsers.py` files within the `salt` and `salt/utils` directories respectively, as well as in integration tests located in the `tests/pytests/integration/cli/test_salt_call.py` to ensure they are consistent with this change.
