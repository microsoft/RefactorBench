In the repository, rename the function 'mksls' in the files preseed.py, kickstart.py, and yast.py to more descriptive names reflecting the specific conversions each module handles. Specifically, in preseed.py rename it to 'preseed_to_sls', in kickstart.py rename it to 'kickstart_to_sls', and in yast.py rename it to 'autoyast_to_sls'. Ensure that the old function name 'mksls' is no longer used in these files.
