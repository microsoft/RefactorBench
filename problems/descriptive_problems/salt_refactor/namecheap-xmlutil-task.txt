Transfer the 'xml_to_dict', 'atts_to_dict', and 'string_to_value' functions from the namecheap.py file to xmlutil.py within the SaltStack repository. Following the transfer, update all references across the codebase that previously referred to these functions in namecheap.py to now point to their new location in xmlutil.py. Ensure that these functions no longer exist in namecheap.py to uphold proper modular functionality.
