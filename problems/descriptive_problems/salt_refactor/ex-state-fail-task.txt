Please update the constant named EX_STATE_FAILURE to EX_STATE_FAIL within the 'exitcodes.py' file located under the 'salt/defaults' directory. Additionally, you should update all references to this constant in two other files: 'state.py' within the 'salt/modules' directory and 'test_salt_call.py' in the 'tests/pytests/integration/cli' directory. Make sure that the updated constant name is correctly reflected and there are no references left to the old constant name in these files.
