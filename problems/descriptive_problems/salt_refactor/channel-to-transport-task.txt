Change the filename of 'channel.py' located in the 'salt/utils' directory to 'transport.py'. Ensure that all references to 'channel.py' in the repository, particularly in 'master.py' and 'server.py' under the 'salt/channel' directory, are updated to reflect this change. Additionally, confirm that the 'iter_transport_opts' function within 'transport.py' is correctly imported and utilized in these updated files.
