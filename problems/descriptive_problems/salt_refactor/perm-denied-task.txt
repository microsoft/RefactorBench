Rename the constant EX_NOPERM to EX_PERM_DENIED in the 'exitcodes.py' file under the 'salt/defaults' directory. After renaming, ensure that this change is reflected across all usages within the codebase, specifically in 'ssh/__init__.py' within the 'salt/client' directory and 'crypt.py' in the 'salt' directory, where the former constant should no longer be referenced, but the new EX_PERM_DENIED should be in use where necessary.
