Create a new exception class named `PathTraversal` in the `exceptions.py` file, which should inherit from the `SuspiciousOperation` class. Once added, modify the `base.py` file where the `Storage` class methods `get_available_name` and `generate_filename` are defined, ensuring these methods raise the `PathTraversal` exception when needed. Also, remember to ensure the documentation in `exceptions.txt` and functional testing are updated to reflect the changes to `PathTraversal` handling in relevant methods and scenarios.
