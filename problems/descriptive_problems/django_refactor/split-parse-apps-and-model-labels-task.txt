Split the existing function 'parse_apps_and_model_labels' in the file 'utils.py' into two separate functions: one function named 'get_apps_from_labels' that exclusively handles the extraction of apps and another function named 'get_models_from_labels' for handling the extraction of models. Ensure that after making this change, the original 'parse_apps_and_model_labels' function no longer exists in the codebase, and both new functions are being correctly imported and utilized in 'loaddata.py' and 'dumpdata.py'.
