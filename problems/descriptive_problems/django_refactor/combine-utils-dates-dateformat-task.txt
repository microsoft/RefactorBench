Migrate all the relevant content and dependencies from the file named dates.py to dateformat.py within the Django utils directory. Ensure that constants such as WEEKDAYS, WEEKDAYS_ABBR, MONTHS, MONTHS_3, MONTHS_AP, and MONTHS_ALT are transferred correctly to dateformat.py. Following this, verify that the imports in widgets.py and test_selectdatewidget.py are updated to reflect these changes, specifically ensuring that they now import from dateformat.py and no longer reference dates.py, which should be deleted from the repository after the migration.
