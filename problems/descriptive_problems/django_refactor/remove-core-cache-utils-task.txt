Remove the file `utils.py` located within the `django/core/cache` directory and transfer the function `make_template_fragment_key` to the file `cache.py` in the `django/templatetags` directory. Ensure that the documentation updates are made within the file `cache.txt` located under the `docs/topics` directory, modifying all references to reflect the new location of this function. Also, update the `tests.py` in the `tests/cache` directory to properly import `make_template_fragment_key` from its new location in `cache.py`. Ensure that all associated tests and documentation consistently reflect this change.
