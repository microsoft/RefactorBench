Create a new class named `ReferenceContext` in the `utils.py` file under the `django/db/migrations` directory to encapsulate all parameters used in `field_references`. Then, modify the `field_references` method calls in the `FieldOperation` class in the `fields.py` file and the `CreateModel` class in the `models.py` file under the `django/db/migrations/operations` directory to use instances of this new `ReferenceContext` class instead of the current argument setup. Make sure to add necessary imports of `ReferenceContext` in these files.
