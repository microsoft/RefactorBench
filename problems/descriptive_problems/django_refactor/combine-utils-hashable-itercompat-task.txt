Combine the functionality of 'hashable.py' and 'itercompat.py' located in the 'django/utils' directory into a new file named 'able.py' within the same directory. Transfer corresponding tests from 'test_hashable.py' and 'test_itercompat.py' in the 'tests/utils_tests' directory to a new test file named 'test_able.py'. After the combination, ensure that the original files ('hashable.py', 'itercompat.py', 'test_hashable.py', and 'test_itercompat.py') are deleted. Additionally, update any import statements in different parts of the codebase to import from 'able.py' instead of from 'hashable.py' and 'itercompat.py'.
