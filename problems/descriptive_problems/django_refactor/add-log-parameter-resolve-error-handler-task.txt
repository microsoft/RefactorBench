Modify the `resolve_error_handler` method in the `resolvers.py` file to include an additional boolean parameter named `log` that controls the activation of logging within the function, with the default value set to `false`. Ensure that all existing calls to `resolve_error_handler` across the repository within the `exception.py`, `urls.py`, and `tests.py` files specifically set this new `log` parameter to `false`.
