Create a new class named `ConverterToPython` in the existing file `utils.py` located within the `django/db/backends` directory of the Django project repository. This class should include methods for: `typecast_date`, `typecast_time`, and `typecast_timestamp` to handle conversions from string types to Python objects. Additionally, ensure that this class is correctly imported in both the `sqlite3/_functions.py` file and the `mysql/base.py` file under the `django/db/backends` directory tree. Update the repository with these changes to include the new functionality for handling data type conversions.
