Transfer the _path_from_module function from the config.py file (located in the 'apps' directory of the Django project) to a newly created file named apps_utils.py within the same 'apps' directory. Ensure that after moving the function, it is correctly imported in the config.py file, where it was originally located. Additionally, verify that the _path_from_module function is implemented with the necessary 'module' parameter in the new apps_utils.py file.
