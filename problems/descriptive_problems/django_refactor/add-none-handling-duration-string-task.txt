Modify the `duration_string` function in the file `duration.py` located under the `utils` directory to handle cases where its input parameter is `None`, drawing from existing patterns in the `DurationField` class's `value_to_string` method within the `__init__.py` file in the `django/db/models/fields` directory. Additionally, create a new test method named `test_none` in the `TestDurationString` class within the `test_duration.py` file under `tests/utils_tests`, ensuring it correctly checks for appropriate handling of `None` values in `duration_string`.
