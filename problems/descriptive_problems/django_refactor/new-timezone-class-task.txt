Develop a class within the 'utils.py' file located in the 'django/forms' directory that encapsulates the timezone-related functions 'from_current_timezone' and 'to_current_timezone'. Once the class is created, make sure all existing calls to these functions throughout the repository (especially in files like 'fields.py' and 'widgets.py' within the same directory) are updated to use the new class. Additionally, ensure that this new class is imported and utilized correctly in these files.
