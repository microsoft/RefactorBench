Please transfer all contents from the file named "constants" within the "django/db/models" directory to the file named "base" located within the same directory. Following this transfer, meticulously update all relevant import statements across various files including, but not limited to: 'checks.py', 'options.py', 'fields/__init__.py', 'fields/json.py', 'fields/related.py' amongst others in the Django framework codebase, ensuring imports reference "django.db.models.base" instead of "django.db.models.constants" for any components that were moved.
