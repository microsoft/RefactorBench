Rename the function `file_move_safe` to `safe_file_move` in the file `move.py` located within the django/core/files/ directory, and modify other files in the repository where this function is imported or called, specifically within the filebased.py and filesystem.py in the django/core/cache/backends/ and django/core/files/storage/ directories respectively, as well as the tests.py in the tests/files/ directory. Additionally, update the old documentation or release note files, especially `1.11.2.txt` in the docs/releases/ directory, to indicate "now changed to safe_file_move" wherever the old function name was referenced. Ensure that all related comments within these files also reflect this new function name.
