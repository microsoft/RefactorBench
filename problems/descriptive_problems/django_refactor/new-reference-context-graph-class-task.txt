Develop a new class named `ReferenceContext` within the file `graph.py` located in the `/django/db/migrations/graph` directory. This class should encapsulate all parameters previously used in the `add_dependency` method. Following the creation of this class, ensure that the `add_dependency` method utilizes an instance of `ReferenceContext` for its operations in the files `loader.py`, `test_executor.py`, `test_graph.py`, and `test_autodetector.py`. This new implementation should not be applied to the `deletion.py` file in the `/django/db/models` directory.
