In the file named test_request.py within the unit test directory for the worker, modify the import statements to ensure that the function 'mro_lookup' is directly imported from its original file instead of being relayed through another module. Make sure this change is reflected by directly referencing the source module 'celery.utils.objects' without any intermediate redirection. This ensures that all dependencies and links in the test_request.py file are straightforward and maintain clarity in module relationships.
