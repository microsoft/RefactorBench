Please modify the function 'get_digest_algorithm' in the file named 'utils.py' within the 'celery/security' directory to include an additional boolean parameter named 'log'. Set the default value of this parameter to False. In files other than those within the testing directories, adjust all calls to this function to set the 'log' parameter to True. This detailed change affects how logging behavior is controlled through this parameter across different usages in the repository, ensuring that logging is enabled in operational contexts but can be disabled for testing scenarios where the filename is 'test_key.py' or similar test files.
