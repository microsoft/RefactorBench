Move the `expand_router_string` function to the `utils.py` file within the `celery/app` directory, ensuring it is appropriately defined there. Afterward, update the `routes.py` file in the same directory to import the `expand_router_string` function from `celery.app.utils`. Additionally, make sure `expand_router_string` is included in the `__all__` list inside `utils.py` to maintain proper module exports.
