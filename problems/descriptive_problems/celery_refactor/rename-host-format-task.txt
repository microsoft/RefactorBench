In the file "nodenames.py" located within the "celery/utils" directory, rename the function previously known as "host_format" to "format_host." Additionally, ensure all references to this function across the repository are updated to reflect this change, including ensuring "format_host" is present in the "__all__" list within "nodenames.py". Review related files such as "worker.py" in the "celery/bin" directory and "multi.py" in the "celery/apps" directory to verify that these files correctly import and do not mistakenly call the outdated function name.
