Rename the file named autoretry.py to retry.py within the celery/app directory and ensure all references throughout the repository are updated accordingly. This includes updating imports in code files such as base.py, references in documentation files like index.rst and bandit.json, and ensuring the respective documentation files celery.app.autoretry.rst and celery.app.retry.rst are respectively deleted and created under docs/reference. Ensure any newly created or updated files correctly reflect the changes in their content.
