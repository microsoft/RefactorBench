Merge the implementation found in the _unpickle_task_v2 function into _unpickle_task in the registry.py file. After combining these functions, remove any remnants of _unpickle_task_v2 from the codebase. Subsequently, update all associated tests, located in files such as task.py, test_registry.py and others within the testing directory, ensuring that only references to _unpickle_task remain without altering the fundamental purpose or nature of the tests.
