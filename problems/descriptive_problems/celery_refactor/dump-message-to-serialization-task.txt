Transfer the `dump_message` function from the `amqp.py` file in the `celery/bin` directory to the `serialization.py` file located in the `celery/utils` directory. Make sure that the `amqp.py` file no longer includes the `dump_message` function definition and is instead importing it from its new location in `serialization.py`. Update all references and imports throughout the repository to reflect this change, ensuring that `dump_message` is only defined in `serialization.py` and correctly imported where necessary.
