Rename the file named 'utils.py' located in the 'openapi' folder of the 'fastapi' directory to 'get_utils.py'. Subsequently, update all references to 'utils.py' in the codebase, including Python scripts and Markdown documentation files, to 'get_utils.py'. This change should reflect in various locations including 'applications.py', 'tutorial001.py' under 'docs_src/extending_openapi', and 'extending-openapi.md' files across different language directories in 'docs'. Ensure updates are made wherever 'openapi.utils' is referenced.
