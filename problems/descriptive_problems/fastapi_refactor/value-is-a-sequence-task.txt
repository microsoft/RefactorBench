In the FastAPI repository, refactor the `value_is_sequence` function to be renamed as `value_is_a_sequence` within the `_compat.py` file. Ensure all references and usage of this function in `_compat.py` and other files such as `utils.py` under `dependencies` reflect this name change. Additionally, verify and update necessary imports to accommodate the new function name ensuring consistency across the repository.
