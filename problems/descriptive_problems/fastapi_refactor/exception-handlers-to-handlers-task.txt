Rename the file 'exception_handlers.py' to 'handlers.py' in the FastAPI module and ensure all references within the repository are updated to reflect this new file name. Documents in multiple language directories under 'docs', specifically in files like 'handling-errors.md', and source files such as 'applications.py' and 'tutorial006.py' in the 'docs_src/handling_errors' and 'fastapi' directories respectively, should be updated to use 'handlers.py' instead of 'exception_handlers.py'. Ensure that relevant imports in 'applications.py' and 'tutorial006.py' are correctly pointed to 'fastapi.handlers'.
