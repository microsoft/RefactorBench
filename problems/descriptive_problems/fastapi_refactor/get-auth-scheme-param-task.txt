Please rename the function `get_authorization_scheme_param` to `get_auth_scheme_param` in the file `utils.py` located in the `security` directory of the FastAPI repository. Ensure that all instances where it was used or referred to are updated accordingly in that file. Additionally, confirm the usage of this renamed function in the `oauth2.py` and `http.py` files, also under the `security` directory, by updating any imports or function calls that reference the original function name.
