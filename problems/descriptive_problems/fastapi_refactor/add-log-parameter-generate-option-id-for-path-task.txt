In the `utils.py` file within the `fastapi` directory, update the `generate_operation_id_for_path` function by adding a new boolean parameter named 'log' and set its default value to `False`. Furthermore, for every occurrence where this function is called in the `utils.py` file located in the `fastapi/openapi` directory, ensure the 'log' parameter is explicitly passed with the value `True`.
