Please transfer all contents from the file '_internal_utils.py' to 'utils.py' within the 'requests' module and ensure this file, '_internal_utils.py', is deleted after the transfer. Update all internal references in the application notably in files like 'auth.py', 'cookies.py', 'models.py', 'sessions.py', and 'test_utils.py' to import necessary functions directly from 'requests.utils' instead of 'requests._internal_utils'. This should include updates for imports such as 'to_native_string' and other specific methods previously used from '_internal_utils'.
