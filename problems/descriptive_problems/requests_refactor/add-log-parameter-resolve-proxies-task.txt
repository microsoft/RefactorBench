Update the 'resolve_proxies' function in the 'utils.py' file of the 'requests' directory by adding a new boolean parameter named 'log'. Set the default value of 'log' to False in the 'utils.py' file only. In all other files within the 'requests' directory except those in the 'tests' subdirectory, ensure that every invocation of the 'resolve_proxies' function explicitly passes 'log=True'. This includes but is not limited to the 'sessions.py' file where this parameter should certainly be passed.
