Remove the 'hooks.py' file from the 'src/requests' directory and integrate its contents into the 'sessions.py' in the same directory. Ensure that all references throughout the repository, including files like 'models.py' and 'test_requests.py', are updated to import the necessary functions from 'sessions.py' instead of 'hooks.py'. Make sure 'sessions.py' does not contain any imports from the now-obsolete 'hooks.py'.
