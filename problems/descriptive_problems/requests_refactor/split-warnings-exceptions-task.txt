Create a new file named `warnings.py` in the same directory as `exceptions.py` within the `requests` module, and transfer all warning-related classes (such as `RequestsWarning`, `FileModeWarning`, and `RequestsDependencyWarning`) from `exceptions.py` to this new file. Ensure you update all the references in the repository such that any module requiring these warnings imports them from `warnings.py` instead of `exceptions.py`. Additionally, remove these classes from `exceptions.py` to avoid duplicate definition of warning classes.
