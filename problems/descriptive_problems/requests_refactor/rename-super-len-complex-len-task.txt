Rename the function `super_len` to `complex_len` in the file named `utils.py` located within the `src/requests` directory. Subsequently, update the respective import statements and usage of this function in the files named `models.py` in the `src/requests` directory and `test_utils.py` in the `tests` directory. Ensure that the original `super_len` function is fully replaced by `complex_len` and that there are no remnants of `super_len` in any file.
