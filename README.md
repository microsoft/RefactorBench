# RefactorBench
Refactoring benchmark of real-world, multi-hop tasks within the realm of code.




# Attribution
In this repository we contain the exact copies of repositories that were used for the task and test generation parts of RefactorBench. To run agents on these repositories, we recommend using SWE-agent's Docker solution where a copy of the repository is loaded onto an image and persists for all task instances. We find that this allows local running of RefactorBench (previously a huge blocker for democratizing access to software engineering agent research)!
